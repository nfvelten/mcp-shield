# Contributing to arbit

Contributions are welcome — bug fixes, new features, tests, and documentation.

## Before you start

For anything beyond a small fix, open an issue first to discuss the approach. This avoids wasted work if the direction doesn't fit the project. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full development workflow and design principles.

## Setup

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust stable (1.85+)
git clone https://github.com/nfvelten/arbit
cd arbit
cargo build
```

Node.js is only needed for the stdio integration tests (`#[ignore]` by default).

## Running the tests

```bash
# All unit tests (fast, no external deps)
cargo test --lib

# All integration tests (spins up real gateway + dummy MCP server)
cargo test --test http_gateway
cargo test --test security_coverage
cargo test --test attack_scenarios

# stdio tests (requires npx — excluded from CI)
cargo test --test stdio_gateway -- --ignored

# Full suite
cargo test --all-features
```

## Code quality (required before every push)

```bash
cargo fmt --check        # must pass — no formatting violations
cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # must pass — zero warnings
cargo test --lib         # all unit tests green
```

## Project structure

```

## Design principles

- **Traits over structs** — `Transport`, `McpUpstream`, `AuditLog`, `Middleware` are traits; new implementations don't touch the core.
- **No blocking in async context** — SQLite and heavy I/O go through `spawn_blocking`; audit `record()` is fire-and-forget via bounded channels.
- **Hot-reload without restart** — `tokio::sync::watch` propagates a new `Arc<LiveConfig>` to all middleware. Middleware snapshots what it needs and drops the borrow before any `.await` to stay `Send`.
- **Security by default** — block patterns, rate limits, and auth checks apply to all agents unless explicitly relaxed. New inputs validated at the boundary.
- **Tests before merge** — every new public function or behaviour must have at least one unit test; security-sensitive paths require both a happy-path and an adversarial test.

## Workflow

1. Open or reference a GitHub issue
2. Create a branch: `feat/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>` from `master`
3. Make your changes with tests
4. Update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`
5. Run the quality checklist above
6. Open a PR referencing the issue (`Closes #N`)
